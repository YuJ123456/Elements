The P-rich sites, developing on phosphate rocks with high P content, are located in Kunming City (latitude 24°58′54.38″ N, longitude 102°26′47.58″ E, altitude 1869 m a.s.l), and P-deficient sites, developing on non-phosphate rocks with low P content, at Mouding in Chuxiong City (latitude 25°14′48.25″ N, longitude 101°32′35.62″ E, altitude 1846 m a.s.l), Yunnan Province, China. The stands at P-rich (Kunming) and P-deficient (Mouding) sites are natural forests and left over by history.
Depend on the location and size of the Q. variabilis stands, at July, six P-rich sites (20m × 20m) and P-deficient sites (20 m × 20 m) were established, respectively. At August and September, eight P-rich sites (20m × 20m) and twelve P-deficient sites (20 m × 20 m) were established, respectively. And each site contains three plots. In the stand of the P-rich site, the height of Q. variabilis trees ranged from 17.67 m to 31.67 m, and DBH (diameter at breast height) from 21.74 cm to 48.41 cm. In the stand of the P-deficient site, the height of Q. variabilis trees ranged from 22.5 m to 25.00 m, and DBH from 16.03 cm to 28.66 cm. And three stages of acorn development were established: early stage (July), middle stage (August), late stage (September), based on the content variation of major substances (Hao, 2010) and developmental characteristics (Merouani et al., 2003, Huang, 2014). Acorns were collected randomly at each oak plot in the middle of July, August and September. To conduct chemical analysis, acorns were dried at 65 °C for 5 d and ground into powder.
